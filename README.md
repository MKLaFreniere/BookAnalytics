# BookAnalytics

  This program was made as a later project in my Intro to Python course. 
Simply put, it takes a txt file and plots a graph of the longest words 
and the most frequent words. This helped me undertand the plotting capabilities
of python, but also made me use new techniques to complete it.

  It utilizes matplot in order to work and essentially functions by creating a list that
tallies the amount of time of times a word appears, as well as its length.
If you test this program on your own, especially with the sample text of Frankenstein, 
be prepared to wait a bit as the program needs to check every word.
